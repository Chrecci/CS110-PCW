This is not the same as simply tracking an algorithm's run time. The run time itself can not tell us how the algorithm performs as inputs change, only for that one input. Thus, we wouldn't know how alogirthm scales or compares with other algorithms in the long run. As such, time complexity can be a useful meaure for an algorithm's efficiency, and even for comparing against other algorithms."
